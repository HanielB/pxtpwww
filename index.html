                    <h2>Sixth Workshop on Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving</h2>
                    <h1>PxTP 2019</h1>
                    <p>Affiliated with the <a href="https://www.mat.ufrn.br/cade-27/">27th International Conference
                        on Automated Deduction</a> (CADE-27)</p>
                    <p>25-26 August 2019, Natal, Brazil</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>The PxTP workshop
                    brings together researchers working on various aspects of
                    communication, integration, and cooperation between reasoning systems
                    and formalisms.</p>

                <p>The progress in computer-aided reasoning,
                    both automated and interactive,
                    during the past decades, made it possible to build deduction tools that are
                    increasingly more applicable to a wider range of problems and are able to
                    tackle larger problems progressively faster. In recent years, cooperation
                    of such tools in larger verification environments has demonstrated the
                    potential to reduce the amount of manual intervention.
                    Examples include the Sledgehammer tool providing
                    an interface between Isabelle and (untrusted)
                    automated provers, and also collaboration between HOL Light and Isabelle
                    in the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture.</p>

                <p>Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of
                    theoretical formalisms and practical tools to exchange problems,
                    proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such
                    cooperation by inviting contributions on suitable integration,
                    translation and communication methods, standards, protocols,
                    and programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes the interested
                    developers of automated and interactive theorem proving tools,
                    developers of combined systems, developers and users of translation
                    tools and interfaces, and producers of standards and protocols. We are also
                    interested both in success stories and in descriptions of the current
                    bottlenecks and proposals for improvement.</p>

                <h2>Topics</h2>

                <p>
                    Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of
                    cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or interactive.
                    More specifically, some suggested topics are:</p>


                <li> applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally
                    with certification of the result);</li>

                <li> interoperability of reasoning systems;</li>

                <li> translations between logics, proof systems, models;</li>

                <li> distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous
                    reasoning tools;</li>

                <li> algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,
                    reconstructing) proofs;</li>

                <li> proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for
                    different classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order
                    logic, higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);</li>

                <li> meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,
                    standards, protocols, and APIs related to problems, proofs,
                    and models;</li>

                <li> comparison, refactoring, transformation, migration,
                    compression and optimization of proofs;</li>

                <li> data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in
                    solvers (e.g. efficient proof representations); </li>

                <li> (universal) libraries, corpora and benchmarks of proofs and theories;</li>

                <li> alignment of diverse logics, concepts and theories across systems and libraries;</li>

                <li> engineering aspects of proofs
                    (e.g. granularity, flexiformality, persistence over time);</li>

                <li> proof certificates;</li>

                <li> proof checking;</li>

                <li> mining of (mathematical) information from proofs
                    (e.g. quantifier instantiations, unsat cores, interpolants, ...);</li>

                <li> reverse engineering and understanding of formal proofs;</li>

                <li> universality of proofs;</li>

                <li> origins and kinds of proofs
                    (e.g. (in)formal, automatically generated, interactive, ...);</li>

                <li> Hilbert's 24th Problem (i.e. what makes a proof better than another?);</li>

                <li> social aspects (e.g. community-wide initiatives related to proofs,
                    cooperation between communities, the future of (formal) proofs);</li>

                <li> applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem
                    provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code,
                    or certified compilation;</li>

                <li> application-oriented proof theory;</li>

                <li> practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies;</li>

</ul>
